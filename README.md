## Instructions

Please take a look at the [instructions document.](https://outrageous-nerve-ab9.notion.site/Helium-Full-Stack-Homework-2455f4c835f0809e99ccff933d48313f)

You will be provided a small AI chat-based application that outputs React components given a user prompt, like a simple vibe-code tool. The application is simple, and is prompted to only produce simple isolated components. The components will be outputted into an preview component, and can be seen right in the browser.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
